         * The physics system checks for box to box collisions by considering the two corners nearest
         * the collisions. For example, when checking if the box is touching the ground, it needs to see
         * if the bottom-left corner or the bottom-right corner are touching the ground. If either are,
         * it will stop the box from moving downard. This causes a slight issue however. Say the character 
         * were pressed up against a wall to his right while falling. In this case the bottom right corner would be
         * registering a collision, and it would stop him from falling. To fix this error, I have included the
         * MARGIN variable which brings the corners slightly inside to avoid false collision. For example, when
         * checking for ground collisions, the bottom right corner, will be at the same y-coordinate, but
         * its x-coordinate will be moved slightly left. You can visualize these collision detectors as so:
         *         
         *              U.............U
         *             L...............R
         *             .................
         *             .................
         *             .................
         *             .................
         *             .................
         *             L...............R
         *              B.............B
         *   
         * So what this means is that the ground detection will be checked by the two B locations, while the right
         * wall detection will be checked by the two R locations. This effectively stops the box from getting
         * stuck in unfortunate situations, but it also creates a tradeoff. If margin is too small, there is a
         * high probability that it will register a false collision and stop the block. If the margin is too large
         * The physics will look unrealistic and clip too far around corners. The MARGIN variable controls how far
         * to bring in the corners. The total distance to bring in the corners:
         *
         *      distance-in-pixels = MARGIN*width-of-one-cell
         * 
         * Also note: two dynamic objects on top of each other is unpredictable (just make a taller dynamic
         * object to overcome this), but a player on top of dynamic objects is fine.
